# Alzheimer-Detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements an AI-based system for early dementia detection using MRI brain scans. It leverages Gabor feature extraction and machine learning classifiers (SVM, Random Forest) to distinguish between demented and non-demented patients with high accuracy.

By combining medical image preprocessing, texture-based feature extraction, and robust ML models, the project demonstrates the potential of AI in healthcare diagnostics, specifically for Alzheimerâ€™s and dementia screening.


ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
MRI brain scan dataset with 6,400 images across different dementia stages
Preprocessing: resizing, noise reduction, train/test split (80:20)

Feature extraction:
GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) â†’ baseline accuracy (~70%)
Gabor Filters â†’ boosted accuracy (~93%)

Classification models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest
Cross-validation (5-fold) to validate robustness


ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle â€“ MRI Dementia Brain Images
Classes:
Mild Demented (896 images)
Moderate Demented (64 images)
Very Mild Demented (2240 images)
Non-Demented (3200 images)
